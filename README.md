A blockchain mainly for transactions implemented in python read the code and conrtibute

inspired by the bitcoin whitepaper i wrote the algorithmn based on that ,
if you're reading this you can now own your own chain i have simplified it to a single file 
Just remember the value of a network is not the algorithmn it's the number of users it has on it's network

with this you can git pull the code and use it as a library on your project i used it for sending commands in a smarthome project not yet on gituhub worked fine.Hope you use it too and create cool projects
